# Snake-Game

Description:
This is a recreation of the famous web browser game "Snake" in Java. This version shares essentially all feautres with its original counterpart. An apple appears randomly on screen and the user must guide their snake towards the apple using the arrow keys in order to "eat" the apple. Upon consuming the apple, the snake grows in length by one unit and the apple subsequently reappears somewhere random on screen. Additionally upon apple consumption, the players score increases. The score doubles is equal to the length of the snake. If the player hits a wall or hits another part of the snake, the game is over.
